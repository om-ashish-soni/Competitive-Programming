We will go step by step journey for competitive programming and Data Structures and Algorithms

Phase 0 : Why Competitive Coding & DSA
======================================

*   MNCs and Medium size companies takes coding round & technical rounds in interview there they ask for data structures and algorithms problems.
*   Lot of real world problems can be solved very easily by using dsa.
*   **This boosts your critical thinking, cognitive thinking, debugging and implementation skills, which helps infinitely as a future Software Engineer.**

**CP vs DSA :**

*   DSA is helpful for placement, Competitive Coding is super set of DSA.
*   Competitive Coding is more like a game, brain sport, where people compete using human brain to solve any problem. DSA is more or less structured way of preparing for tech interviews.
*   Competitive Coding changes the fundamental way of thinking and tackling real world problems of life.

**Personal Opinion :**

*   If I was in my 1st / 2nd / 3rd year of college, I would start CP & DSA from today itself.
*   **It’s never late to start.**

**Phase 1 : Pick one programming language**
===========================================

*   C++ , Java, Python ( pypy3 )
*   Learn the basics of language from youtube, geeksforgeeks, w3schools
    Learn about data types, operators, function, syntax, etc.

**Phase 2 : Start Basic Problem Solving on Hackerrank :**
=========================================================

Start solving picked language problems on hackerrank **_( Any 1 language )_**:

1. [Solve C Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/c)

2. [Solve C++ Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp)

3. [Solve Java Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java)

4. [Solve Python Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)

*   Once you do any one of the above, you will have some grip on problem solving and language specific.
*   If you are not able to solve any problem, don’t giveup try the compile time and run time errors solution looking on google, stack overflow, geeks for geeks etc.
*   Atleast try for 10–20 times before looking at solution.

**Start your problem solving with pattern printing problems**

*   You by do pattern printing in any language, that helps building logic.

**How to practice on leetcode or any other platforms**
------------------------------------------------------

*   Filter problems like below highlighted from easy to medium to hard,
*   Solve easy first gradually moving to medium, keep hard for some later time.

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*ZivKctbePDWsJwyU5DPFHQ.png)

*   Visit to leetcode.com, select a specific topic and start solving easy problems on it.
*   The more number of accepted solutions means the more easy problem is.

**Topic-Wise Practice**:

*   Focused practice on a specific topic ensures you master the underlying concepts and techniques.
*   It helps build confidence and prepares you to handle problems of that particular type with ease.

**Random Problem-Solving**:

*   Solving random problems simulates real competition scenarios where you don’t know the topic beforehand.
*   It trains you to identify the relevant topic and approach for solving the problem.
*   This practice improves adaptability, problem-recognition skills, and overall versatility as a programmer.

Advice to solve problem effectively:
====================================

1.  Have pen and paper,

2. Read problem twice

3. Read constraints twice

4. List all approaches you can think of

5. Dry run all tests cases with your hand on paper

6. Now whatever you did see how can you code for it

7. Atleast try for 1–2 hours before giving up

8. Still can’t get it, try to see the topics

9. Still can’t get it, try to see hint 1,2,…

10. Still can’t get it, try to read blogs of other people’s solution, read approach and code if needed

11. Still can’t get it, then watch video

12. After you solve with editorials then observe what you missed

Phase 6 : Learning Math, Number Theory , Bit Manipulations
==========================================================

*   **Math, Number Theory** are all school level topics, for example primality, factorization, odd — even number, GCD, LCM etc.
*   **Bit manipulation** may be something new, may need to learn. Each number in the machine will be represented at the end using 0s and 1s, these are the problems based on bits. Binary Operations like bitwise AND, OR, NOT, XOR etc.

Phase 15 : Dynamic Programming
==============================

Ooooppps ! the most obsessfull topic you may think

Actually its very easy to solve and implement if you know it and hands on it.

**If you don’t remember the past, you are condemned to repeat it.**

*   Overlapping subproblems property
*   We decompose the problem in smaller subproblems and then we solve sub problems and reusing already stored solution.
*   DP problems are optimization problems like minimizing, maximizing,
*   DP is also used with combinatorics which we will see later.
*   DP can be combined with any topic, binary search, string, graph, tree any thing.

**There are 2 types of DP :**

1.  **Tabulation ( Iterative — Tabular )** — Easy to solve and implement in longer time, more widely used
2.  **Memoization ( Recursive )** — Good to start with

**Great start for dp ( don’t focus on language of video , focus on topic )**

How to Read a Problem?
======================

1.  **Pay Attention to Problem Statement:** Take extra care to read the problem statement correctly. Mistakes in understanding the problem can lead to wrong solutions. For example, distinguishing between “undirectional” and “unidirectional” graphs (undirected vs directed) can significantly impact the approach.
2.  **Analyze the Constraints:** Understanding the problem constraints can provide valuable insights into choosing the appropriate algorithms and data structures to solve the problem effectively.

Tips for contests and competitive programming
=============================================

1.  **Stuck in a Contest**: If you feel stuck during a contest, take a short break of 1 or 2 minutes. Wash your face to refresh yourself and then start again with a clear mind.
2.  **Can't Improve**: If you're struggling to improve, try upsolving. If you can't come up with any ideas, refer to the editorial. If there is an unfamiliar topic, learn it and repeat this process.
3.  **How to Boost Performance**: Participating in long challenges on Codechef can help boost your performance and allow you to learn various tips and techniques.
4.  **Combining Different Approaches to Solve Problems:** When faced with a problem, try multiple approaches. For example, if it's a graph problem, start with DFS. If that's not enough, try using disjoint sets. If there's a need for path compression, use it. If the constraints allow, consider using Fenwick trees. This approach helps you combine different techniques to solve problems effectively.
5.  **Difficulty with Last 3 to 4 Problems of a Contest:** If your basics are clear, practice a lot of problems related to trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and segment trees until you feel satisfied.
6.  **Where and How to Practice:**

*   Hackerrank is a good platform for beginners to learn a programming language.
*   Once you have a basic grip on a language, move to the problem set on Codeforces.
*   Solve problems on Codeforces with ratings below 1000.
*   Practice problems based on specific topics from the Codeforces problem set.
*   Participate in contests on Codeforces and Codechef.
*   Upsolve problems. If you can't solve a problem within 30 minutes, refer to the editorial. Learn any unfamiliar topics and repeat this process.
*   As your rating improves, continue step 4 and solve problems within the rating range of [your rating - 100, your rating + 100].
*   Keep learning new algorithms and practice implementing them.

1.  **How Problem Setters Find New Problems**: Not all problems in contests are built from scratch. Many problems are a mixture of multiple problems from resources like the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/).
2.  **Getting TLE with String as a Key in Ordered Map:** If you're experiencing performance issues with a string as a key in an ordered map, try using a hash map instead. This change may improve the performance.
3.  **IDE Recommendation**: In competitive programming, it's recommended not to use an IDE. Instead, develop a habit of using a text editor like Vim, this is optional you may avoid it.
4.  **Which Template Should I Use in CP?:** There are various templates available for competitive programming. You can refer to the following resource for templates that are useful in competitive coding: [Templates Useful for CP](https://iq.opengenus.org/cpp-template-for-competitive-coding/)
5.  **Tips to solve Constuctive :**

*   Writing a brute force script rather than manual solving
*   Finding a pattern
*   Coding optimized solution corresponding to pattern
*   Taking care of edge cases.

## Improving Sorting (Ruffle Sort Inspired from Second Thread's Code)

Here's an implementation of the Ruffle Sort algorithm inspired by code from the second thread:

```java
static void ruffleSort(int[] a) {
    int n = a.length; // Shuffle, then sort
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int oi = random.nextInt(n);
        int temp = a[oi];
        a[oi] = a[i];
        a[i] = temp;
    }
    Arrays.sort(a);
}
```

## codechef Roadmap
  1. start with array -> practice -> 2 🌟
  2. learn c++ stl or any language similar library, dp -> 3 🌟
  3. disjoint set union , graph, little dsa -> 4 🌟
  4. segment tree -> 5 🌟
  5. Codechef has very nice problems on Bit manipulation So , making good grip over bit manip can help in contest.

## Codeforces Suggestion 
  1. Codeforces requires speed of solving problems.
  2. Even if you solve only 2-3 problems , but very quickly then , you will get fruitful ratings.
  3. Upsolving is required since the problem pattern might be repeated in future problems.
  4. First two questions are mostly greedy in div -2,3,4 contests. No prior knowledge except programming language is required.
  5. Below is example how upsolving looks like 
  ![cf upsolving](https://github.com/om-ashish-soni/Competitive-Programming/blob/main/upsolved_all/cf_790.PNG)

## Troubleshooting Error on Codeforces for Java
If you encounter the error "Source should satisfy regex [^{}]*public\s+(final)?\s*class\s+(\w+)" while using Java on Codeforces, follow this guide to resolve the issue: [Troubleshooting Java Error on Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/98846)

## Python: Jumping by 2
You can easily jump by 2 in Python using the `range()` function with a step size of 2. Here's an example:
```python
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
  print(i)
```
